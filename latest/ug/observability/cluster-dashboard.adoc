== What is the Amazon EKS Dashboard?

The Amazon EKS Dashboard provides consolidated visibility into your Kubernetes clusters across multiple {aws} Regions and {aws} Accounts. With this dashboard, you can:

* Track clusters scheduled for end-of-support auto-upgrades within the next 90 days.
* Project EKS control plane costs for clusters in extended support.
* Review clusters with insights that need attention before upgrading.
* Identify managed node groups running specific AMI versions.
* Monitor cluster support type distribution (standard compared to extended support).

The EKS dashboard integrates with EKS Cluster Insights to surface issues with your clusters, such as use of deprecated Kubernetes APIs. For more information, see <<cluster-insights>>. 

== How does the dashboard use {aws} Organizations?

The Amazon EKS dashboard requires {aws} Organizations integration for functionality. It leverages {aws} Organizations to securely gather cluster information across accounts. This integration provides centralized management and governance as your {aws} infrastructure scales.

If {aws} Organizations isn't enabled for your infrastructure, see the {aws}link:organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html[Organizations User Guide, type="documentation"] for setup instructions.

=== Cross-region and cross-account access

The EKS Dashboard can see cluster resources in any account that is a member of the {aws} organization. To generate a list of {aws} accounts in your organization, see link:organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_export.html[Export details for all accounts in an organization,type="documentation"].

The us-east-1 {aws} region generates the dashboard. You must log in to this region to see the dashboard. The dashboard aggregates data across {aws} regions, but this does not include `GovCloud` or China regions. 

=== Key terms

* *{aws} Organization*: A unified management structure for multiple {aws} accounts.
* *Management account*: The primary account that controls the {aws} Organization.
* *Member account*: Any account within the organization except the management account.
* *Delegated administrator*: A member account granted specific cross-account administrative permissions. Within the management account, you can select one delegated administrator account per {aws} Service.
* *Trusted access*: Authorization for the EKS Dashboard to access cluster information across organizational accounts.
* *Service-Linked Role (SLRs)*: A unique type of IAM role directly linked to an {aws} service. The EKS Dashboard uses a SLR to read information about your accounts and organizations. 
* For more information, see link:organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html[Terminology and concepts, type="documentation"] in the {aws} Organizations User Guide. 

=== General overview

. Access the management account of your {aws} Organization.
** The steps to access the management account depend on how you have configured your {aws} Organization. For example, you might access the management account via {aws} link:iam/identity-center/[Identity Center,type="marketing"] or link:https://www.okta.com/partners/aws/[Okta]. 
. Enable Trusted access through the EKS Console.
. Assign a Delegated administrator using their {aws} Account ID.
. Switch to the Delegated administrator account.
. Access the enhanced EKS Console with organization-wide visibility.

== Enable the EKS Dashboard using the {aws} console

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must be logged in to the Management Account of your {aws} Organization to enable the EKS Dashboard.
====

=== Access EKS Dashboard settings

. Confirm the following:
.. You have {aws} Organizations enabled and configured.
.. You are logged into the Management account of the organization.
.. You are viewing the {aws} Management Console in the us-east-1 region.
. Navigate to the EKS console.
. In the left sidebar, open Dashboard Settings.

=== Set up access to the Amazon EKS Dashboard

. Find the {aws} Account ID of the {aws} Account you want to allow to view the EKS Dashboard.
.. This step is optional, but suggested. If you don't, you can only access the dashboard from the management account. As a best practice, you should limit access to the management account.
. Click *Enable trusted access*.
.. You can now view the dashboard from the management account.
. Click *Register delegated administrator* and input the Account ID of the {aws} Account you will use to view the dashboard.
.. You can now view the dashboard from the delegated administrator account or the management account.

== View the EKS dashboard

. Log in to the delegated administrator account (suggested) or the management account.
. Log in to the us-east-1 region.
. Go to the EKS service, and select Dashboard from the left sidebar.

[NOTE]
====
To view and configure the EKS Dashboard, you must have the following IAM permissions:

* `eks:ListDashboardResources`
* `eks:ListDashboardData`
====

== Configure the dashboard

You can configure the view of the dashboard, and filter resources. 

=== Available resources

* *Clusters*: View aggregated information about the status and location of EKS Clusters.
** Clusters with health issues.
** Clusters on EKS Extended Support.
** Breakdown of clusters by Kubernetes version.
* *Managed node groups*: Review Managed node groups and EC2 Instances.
** Node groups by AMI type, such as Amazon Linux or Bottlerocket.
** Node group health issues.
** Instance type distribution.
* *Add-ons*: Learn about what Amazon EKS Add-ons you have installed, and their status.
** Number of installations per add-on.
** Add-ons with health issues.
** Version distribution per add-on.

* *Graph view*
** A customizable widget view displaying graphs and visualizations of the selected resource.
** Changes to the Graph view, such as removing a widget, are visible to all users of the EKS Dashboard.
* *Resource view*
** A list view of the selected resource, supporting filters.
* *Map View*
** View the geographic distribution of the selected resource.

=== Filter the EKS dashboard

You can filter the EKS Dashboard by:

* {aws} Account
* Organizational unit, defined by {aws} Organizations
* {aws} Region

== Disable the EKS dashboard using the {aws} console

. Confirm the following:
.. You have {aws} Organizations enabled and configured.
.. You are logged into the Management account of the organization.
.. You are viewing the {aws} Management Console in the us-east-1 region.
. Navigate to the EKS console.
. In the left sidebar, open Dashboard Settings.
. Click *Disable trusted access*.

== Troubleshoot the EKS dashboard

=== Issue enabling EKS dashboard

* You must be logged in to the management account of an {aws} Organization. 
** If you do not have an {aws} Organization, create one. Learn how to link:organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tutorials_basic.html[Create and configure an organization,type="documentation"].
** If your {aws} account is already a member of an {aws} Organization, identify the administrator of the organization. 
* You must be logged in to the {aws} account with sufficient IAM permissions to create and update {aws} Organizations resources. 

=== Issue viewing the EKS dashboard

* You must be logged in to one of the following {aws} accounts:
** The management account of the {aws} Organization
** A delegated administrator account, identified in the EKS dashboard settings of the management account.

=== Dashboard widgets move unexpectedly

* The EKS Dashboard saves the configurable widget view at the {aws} Account level. If you change the widget view, other people using the same {aws} account will see the changes.
