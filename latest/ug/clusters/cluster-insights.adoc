= Prepare for Kubernetes version upgrades with cluster insights
:info_titleabbrev: Cluster insights

[abstract]
--
Discover how Amazon EKS cluster insights help monitor and resolve potential Kubernetes version upgrade issues for enhanced reliability and faster adoption of new capabilities.
--

Amazon EKS cluster insights provide recommendations to help you follow Amazon EKS and Kubernetes best practices. Every Amazon EKS cluster undergoes automatic, recurring checks against an Amazon EKS curated list of insights. These insight checks are fully managed by Amazon EKS and offer recommendations on how to address any findings.  

* Before updating your cluster Kubernetes version, check the *Cluster insights* tab of the observability dashboard in the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console.,type="console"]
* If your cluster has identified issues, review them and make appropriate fixes. The issues include links to Amazon EKS and Kubernetes.
* After fixing issues, wait for the cluster insights to refresh. If all issues have been resolved, <<update-cluster,update your cluster>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Amazon EKS has temporarily rolled back a feature that would
require you to use a `--force` flag to upgrade your cluster when there were certain cluster insight issues. For more information, see link:https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/2570[Temporary rollback of enforcing upgrade insights on update cluster version] on GitHub.

//If Amazon EKS cluster insights identifies upgrade blocking issues on your cluster, it will prevent you from accidentally upgrading your cluster to the next Kubernetes version until you review and make appropriate fixes to resolve the issues identified. Once the issues are resolved, you will be able to upgrade your cluster.

Amazon EKS refreshes cluster insights every 24 hours. For more information, see <<update-cluster-control-plane>>.

//Amazon EKS refreshes cluster insights every 24 hours, but you can override upgrade insights checks without waiting when needed. For more information, see <<update-cluster-control-plane>>.

====

Amazon EKS returns insights related to Kubernetes version upgrade readiness. Upgrade insights identify possible issues that could impact Kubernetes cluster upgrades. This minimizes the effort that administrators spend preparing for upgrades and increases the reliability of applications on newer Kubernetes versions. Clusters are automatically scanned by Amazon EKS against a list of possible Kubernetes version upgrade impacting issues. Amazon EKS frequently updates the list of insight checks based on reviews of changes made in each Kubernetes version release.

Amazon EKS upgrade insights speed up the testing and verification process for new versions. They also allow cluster administrators and application developers to leverage the newest Kubernetes capabilities by highlighting concerns and offering remediation advice. To see the list of insight checks performed and any relevant issues that Amazon EKS has identified, you can call the Amazon EKS `ListInsights` API operation or look in the Amazon EKS console.

Cluster insights update periodically. You cannot manually refresh cluster insights. If you fix a cluster issue, it will take some time for cluster insights to update. To determine if a fix was successful, compare the time the change  deployed to the "last refresh time" of the cluster insight. 

Amazon EKS automatically creates a cluster access entry. This entry gives EKS permission to view information about your cluster. This information is used to generate the insights. For more information, see <<access-policy-permissions-AmazonEKSClusterInsightsPolicy>>. 

[#cluster-insights-console]
== View cluster insights (Console)
. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. From the cluster list, choose the name of the Amazon EKS cluster for which you want to see the insights.
. Choose *Monitor cluster*.
. Choose the *Cluster Insights* tab.
. In the *Upgrade Insights* table, you will see the following columns:
+
** *Name* – The check that was performed by Amazon EKS against the cluster.
** *Insight status* – An insight with a status of "Error" typically means the impacted Kubernetes version is N+1 of the current cluster version, while a status of "Warning" means the insight applies to a future Kubernetes version N+2 or more. An insight with status of "Passing" means Amazon EKS has not found any issues associated with this insight check in your cluster. An insight status of "Unknown" means Amazon EKS is unable to determine if your cluster is impacted by this insight check.
** *Version* – The Kubernetes version that the insight checked for possible issues.
** *Last refresh time* – The time the status of the insight was last refreshed for this cluster.
** *Last transition time* – The time the status of this insight last changed.
** *Description* – Information from the insight check, which includes the alert and recommended actions for remediation.


[#cluster-insights-cli]
== View cluster insights ({aws} CLI)
. Determine which cluster you would like to check for insights. The following command lists the insights for a specified cluster. Make the following modifications to the command as needed and then run the modified command:
+
** Replace [.replaceable]`region-code` with the code for your {aws} Region.
** Replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your cluster.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes,quotes"]
----
aws eks list-insights --region [.replaceable]`region-code` --cluster-name [.replaceable]`my-cluster`
