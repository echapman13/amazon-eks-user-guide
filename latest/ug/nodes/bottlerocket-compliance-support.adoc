Bottlerocket complies with recommendations defined by various organizations:

* There is a https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/bottlerocket[CIS Benchmark] defined for Bottlerocket. In a default configuration, Bottlerocket image has most of the controls required by CIS Level 1 configuration profile. You can implement the controls required for a CIS Level 2 configuration profile. For more information, see link:containers/validating-amazon-eks-optimized-bottlerocket-ami-against-the-cis-benchmark[Validating Amazon EKS optimized Bottlerocket AMI against the CIS Benchmark,type="blog"] on the {aws} blog.
* The optimized feature set and reduced attack surface means that Bottlerocket instances require less configuration to satisfy PCI DSS requirements. The https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/bottlerocket[CIS Benchmark for Bottlerocket] is an excellent resource for hardening guidance, and supports your requirements for secure configuration standards under PCI DSS requirement 2.2. You can also leverage https://opensearch.org/blog/technical-post/2022/07/bottlerocket-k8s-fluent-bit/[Fluent Bit] to support your requirements for operating system level audit logging under PCI DSS requirement 10.2. {aws} publishes new (patched) Bottlerocket instances periodically to help you meet PCI DSS requirement 6.2 (for v3.2.1) and requirement 6.3.3 (for v4.0).
* Bottlerocket is an HIPAA-eligible feature authorized for use with regulated workloads for both Amazon EC2 and Amazon EKS. For more information, see link:compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/[HIPAA Eligible Services Reference,type="marketing"].
* Bottlerocket AMIs are available that are preconfigured to use FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules. This includes the Amazon Linux 2023 Kernel Crypto API Cryptographic Module and the {aws}-LC Cryptographic Module. For more information, see <<bottlerocket-fips-amis>>.
