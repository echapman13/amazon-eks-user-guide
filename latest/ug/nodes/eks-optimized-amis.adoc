You can deploy nodes with pre-built Amazon EKS optimized link:AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[Amazon Machine Images,type="documentation"] (AMIs) or your own custom AMIs when you use managed node groups or self-managed nodes. If you are running hybrid nodes, see <<hybrid-nodes-os>>. For information about each type of Amazon EKS optimized AMI, see one of the following topics. For instructions on how to create your own custom AMI, see <<eks-ami-build-scripts>>.

With Amazon EKS Auto Mode, EKS manages the EC2 instance including selecting and updating the AMI.
