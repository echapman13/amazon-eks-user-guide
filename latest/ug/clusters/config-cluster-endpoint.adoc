Learn how to enable private access and limit public access to the Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes API server endpoint for enhanced security with your Amazon EKS cluster.
--

You can modify your cluster API server endpoint access using the {aws-management-console} or {aws} CLI in the following sections.



== Configure endpoint access - {aws} console

. Open the link:eks/home#/clusters[Amazon EKS console,type="console"].
. Choose the name of the cluster to display your cluster information.
. Choose the *Networking* tab and choose *Manage endpoint access*.
. For *Private access*, choose whether to enable or disable private access for your cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server endpoint. If you enable private access, [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API requests that originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC endpoint. You must enable private access to disable public access.
. For *Public access*, choose whether to enable or disable public access for your cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server endpoint. If you disable public access, your cluster's [.noloc]`Kubernetes` API server can only receive requests from within the cluster VPC.
. (Optional) If you've enabled *Public access*, you can specify which addresses from the internet can communicate to the public endpoint. Select *Advanced Settings*. Enter a CIDR block, such as [.replaceable]`203.0.113.5/32`. The block cannot include https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses[reserved addresses]. You can enter additional blocks by selecting *Add Source*. There is a maximum number of CIDR blocks that you can specify. For more information, see <<service-quotas>>. If you specify no blocks, then the public API server endpoint receives requests from all IP addresses for both `IPv4`  (`0.0.0.0/0`) and additionally `IPv6` (`::/0`) for dual-stack `IPv6` cluster. If you restrict access to your public endpoint using CIDR blocks, we recommend that you also enable private endpoint access so that nodes and Fargate [.noloc]`Pods` (if you use them) can communicate with the cluster. Without the private endpoint enabled, your public access endpoint CIDR sources must include the egress sources from your VPC. For example, if you have a node in a private subnet that communicates to the internet through a NAT Gateway, you will need to add the outbound IP address of the NAT gateway as part of an allowed CIDR block on your public endpoint.
. Choose *Update* to finish.


== Configure endpoint access - {aws} CLI 

Complete the following steps using the {aws} CLI version `1.27.160` or later. You can check your current version with `aws --version`. To install or upgrade the {aws} CLI, see link:cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[Installing the {aws} CLI,type="documentation"].

. Update your cluster API server endpoint access with the following {aws} CLI command. Substitute your cluster name and desired endpoint access values. If you set `endpointPublicAccess=true`, then you can (optionally) enter single CIDR block, or a comma-separated list of CIDR blocks for `publicAccessCidrs`. The blocks cannot include https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses[reserved addresses]. If you specify CIDR blocks, then the public API server endpoint will only receive requests from the listed blocks. There is a maximum number of CIDR blocks that you can specify. For more information, see <<service-quotas>>. If you restrict access to your public endpoint using CIDR blocks, it is recommended that you also enable private endpoint access so that nodes and Fargate [.noloc]`Pods` (if you use them) can communicate with the cluster. Without the private endpoint enabled, your public access endpoint CIDR sources must include the egress sources from your VPC. For example, if you have a node in a private subnet that communicates to the internet through a NAT Gateway, you will need to add the outbound IP address of the NAT gateway as part of an allowed CIDR block on your public endpoint. If you specify no CIDR blocks, then the public API server endpoint receives requests from all (0.0.0.0/0) IP addresses and additionally `IPv6` (`::/0`) for dual-stack `IPv6` cluster.

NOTE: The following command enables private access and public access from a single IP address for the API server endpoint. Replace [.replaceable]`203.0.113.5/32` with a single CIDR block, or a comma-separated list of CIDR blocks that you want to restrict network access to.

. Monitor the status of your endpoint access update with the following command, using the cluster name and update ID that was returned by the previous command. Your update is complete when the status is shown as `Successful`.
