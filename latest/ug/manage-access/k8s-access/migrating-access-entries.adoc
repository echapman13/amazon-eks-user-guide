= Migrating existing `aws-auth ConfigMap` entries to access entries
:info_titleabbrev: Migrate to access entries

//GDC: problems with xrefs

If you've added entries to the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` on your cluster, we recommend that you create access entries for the existing entries in your `aws-auth` `ConfigMap`. After creating the access entries, you can remove the entries from your `ConfigMap`. You can't associate <<access-policies,access policies>> to entries in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap`. If you want to associate access polices to your IAM principals, create access entries.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* When a cluster is in `API_AND_CONFIGMAP` authentication mode and there's a mapping for the same IAM role in both the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` and in access entries, the role will use the access entry's mapping for authentication. Access entries take precedence over `ConfigMap` entries for the same IAM principal.
* Before removing existing `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` entries that were created by Amazon EKS for <<managed-node-groups,managed node group>> or a <<fargate-profile,Fargate profile>> to your cluster, double check if the correct access entries for those specific resources exist in your Amazon EKS cluster. If you remove entries that Amazon EKS created in the `ConfigMap` without having the equivalent access entries, your cluster won't function properly.
====


== Prerequisites [[migrating_access_entries_prereq]]

* Familiarity with access entries and access policies. For more information, see <<access-entries>> and <<access-policies>>.
* An existing cluster with a platform version that is at or later than the versions listed in the Prerequisites of the <<access-entries>> topic.
* Version `{eksctl-min-version}` or later of the `eksctl` command line tool installed on your device or {aws} CloudShell. To install or update `eksctl`, see https://eksctl.io/installation[Installation] in the `eksctl` documentation.
* Kubernetes permissions to modify the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` in the `kube-system` namespace.
* An {aws} Identity and Access Management role or user with the following permissions: `CreateAccessEntry` and `ListAccessEntries`. For more information, see link:service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonelastickubernetesservice.html#amazonelastickubernetesservice-actions-as-permissions[Actions defined by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service,type="documentation"] in the Service Authorization Reference.

. <<creating-access-entries>> for any of the `ConfigMap` entries that you created returned in the previous output. When creating the access entries, make sure to specify the same values for `ARN`, `USERNAME`, `GROUPS`, and `ACCOUNT` returned in your output. In the example output, you would create access entries for all entries except the last two entries, since those entries were created by Amazon EKS for a Fargate profile and a managed node group. 
. Delete the entries from the `ConfigMap` for any access entries that you created. If you don't delete the entry from the `ConfigMap`, the settings for the access entry for the IAM principal ARN override the `ConfigMap` entry. Replace [.replaceable]`111122223333` with your {aws} account ID and [.replaceable]`EKS-my-cluster-my-namespace-Viewers` with the name of the role in the entry in your `ConfigMap`. If the entry you're removing is for an IAM user, rather than an IAM role, replace `role` with `user` and [.replaceable]`EKS-my-cluster-my-namespace-Viewers` with the user name.
