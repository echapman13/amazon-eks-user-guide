[abstract]
--
Learn how to troubleshoot common issues with Amazon EKS local clusters on {aws} Outposts, including cluster creation failures, node join problems, and control plane instance reachability issues through {aws} Systems Manager.
--

This topic covers some common errors that you might see while using local clusters and how to troubleshoot them. Local clusters are similar to Amazon EKS clusters in the cloud, but there are some differences in how they're managed by Amazon EKS.


[IMPORTANT]
====

Never terminate any managed EKS local cluster `Kubernetes` control-plane instance running on Outpost unless explicitly instructed by {aws} Support. Terminating these instances impose a risk to local cluster service availability, including loss of the local cluster in case multiple instances are simultaneously terminated. EKS local cluster `Kubernetes` control-plane instances are identified by the tag `eks-local:controlplane-name` on the EC2 instance console.

[#outposts-troubleshooting-api-behavior]
.API behavior
[%collapsible]
====

Local clusters are created through the Amazon EKS API, but are run in an asynchronous manner. This means that requests to the Amazon EKS API return immediately for local clusters. However, these requests might succeed, fail fast because of input validation errors, or fail and have descriptive validation errors. This behavior is similar to the Kubernetes API.

Local clusters don't transition to a `FAILED` status. Amazon EKS attempts to reconcile the cluster state with the user-requested desired state in a continuous manner. As a result, a local cluster might remain in the `CREATING` state for an extended period of time until the underlying issue is resolved.

.Describe cluster health field
[%collapsible]
====

Local cluster issues can be discovered using the link:cli/latest/reference/eks/describe-cluster.html[describe-cluster,type="documentation"] Amazon EKS {aws} CLI command. Local cluster issues are surfaced by the `cluster.health` field of the `describe-cluster` command's response. The message contained in this field includes an error code, descriptive message, and related resource IDs. This information is available through the Amazon EKS API and {aws} CLI only. In the following example, replace [.replaceable]`my-cluster` with the name of your local cluster.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --query 'cluster.health'
----

An example output is as follows.

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
{
    "issues": [
        {
            "code": "ConfigurationConflict",
            "message": "The instance type 'm5.large' is not supported in Outpost 'my-outpost-arn'.",
            "resourceIds": [
                "my-cluster-arn"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
----

If the problem is beyond repair, you might need to delete the local cluster and create a new one. For example, trying to provision a cluster with an instance type that's not available on your Outpost. The following table includes common health related errors.

Local clusters require different permissions and policies than Amazon EKS clusters that are hosted in the cloud. When a cluster fails to create and produces an `InvalidPermissions` error, double check that the cluster role that you're using has the <<security-iam-awsmanpol-amazonekslocaloutpostclusterpolicy,AmazonEKSLocalOutpostClusterPolicy>> managed policy attached to it. All other API calls require the same set of permissions as Amazon EKS clusters in the cloud.

[#outposts-troubleshooting-cluster-stuck-in-creating-state]
.Cluster is stuck in `CREATING` state
[%collapsible]
====

The amount of time it takes to create a local cluster varies depending on several factors. These factors include your network configuration, Outpost configuration, and the cluster's configuration. In general, a local cluster is created and changes to the `ACTIVE` status within 15–20 minutes. If a local cluster remains in the `CREATING` state, you can call `describe-cluster` for information about the cause in the `cluster.health` output field. 

The most common issues are the following:



* Your cluster can't connect to the control plane instance from the {aws} Region that Systems Manager is in. You can verify this by calling `aws ssm start-session --target [.replaceable]``instance-id``` from an in-Region bastion host. If that command doesn't work, check if Systems Manager is running on the control plane instance. Or, another work around is to delete the cluster and then recreate it.
* The control plane instances fail to create due to KMS key permissions for EBS volumes. With user managed KMS keys for encrypted EBS volumes, the control plane instances will terminate if the key is not accessible. If the instances are terminated, either switch to an {aws} managed KMS key or ensure that your user managed key policy grants the necessary permissions to the cluster role.
* Systems Manager control plane instances might not have internet access. Check if the subnet that you provided when you created the cluster has a NAT gateway and a VPC with an internet gateway. Use VPC reachability analyzer to verify that the control plane instance can reach the internet gateway. For more information, see link:vpc/latest/reachability/getting-started.html[Getting started with VPC Reachability Analyzer,type="documentation"].
* The role ARN that you provided is missing policies. Check if the <<security-iam-awsmanpol-amazonekslocaloutpostclusterpolicy,{aws} managed policy: AmazonEKSLocalOutpostClusterPolicy>> was removed from the role. This can also occur if an {aws} CloudFormation stack is misconfigured.


* All the provided subnets must be associated with the same Outpost and must reach each other. When multiple subnets are specified when a cluster is created, Amazon EKS attempts to spread the control plane instances across multiple subnets. 
* The Amazon EKS managed security groups are applied at the elastic network interface. However, other configuration elements such as NACL firewall rules might conflict with the rules for the elastic network interface.

[#outposts-troubleshooting-cluster-stuck-in-updating-state]
.Cluster is stuck in `UPDATING` state
[%collapsible]
====

Amazon EKS automatically updates all existing local clusters to the latest platform versions for their corresponding Kubernetes minor version. For more information about platform versions, please refer to <<eks-outposts-platform-versions>>.

During an automatic platform-version rollout a cluster status changes to `UPDATING`. The update process consists of the replacement of all Kubernetes control-plane instances with new ones containing the latest security pathces and bugfixes released for the respective Kubernetes minor version. In general, a local cluster platform update process completes within less than 30 minutes and the cluster changes back to `ACTIVE` status. If a local cluster remains in the `UPDATING` state for an extended period of time, you may call `describe-cluster` to check for information about the cause in the `cluster.health` output field.

Amazon EKS ensures at least 2 out of 3 Kubernetes control-plane instances are healthy and operational cluster nodes in order to maintain the local cluster availability and prevent service interruption. If a local cluster is stalled in `UPDATING` state it is usually because there is some infrastructure or configuration issue preventing the two-instances minimum availability to be guaranteed in case the process continues. So the update process stops progressing to protect the local cluster service interruption.

It is important to troubleshoot a local cluster stuck in `UPDATING` status and address the root-cause so that the update process can complete and restore the local cluster back to `ACTIVE` with the high-availability of 3 Kubernetes control-plane instances.

Do not terminate any managed EKS local cluster `Kubernetes` instances on Outposts unless explicitly instructed by {aws} Support. This is specially important for local clusters stuck in `UPDATING` state because there's a high probability that another control-plane nodes is not completely healthy and terminating the wrong instance could cause service interruption and risk local-cluster data loss.

The most common issues are the following:



* One or more control-plane instances are unable to connect to System Manager because of a networking configuration change since the local cluster was first created. You can verify this by calling `aws ssm start-session --target [.replaceable]``instance-id``` from an in-Region bastion host. If that command doesn't work, check if Systems Manager is running on the control plane instance.
* New control plane instances fail to be created due to KMS key permissions for EBS volumes. With user managed KMS keys for encrypted EBS volumes, the control plane instances will terminate if the key is not accessible. If the instances are terminated, either switch to an {aws} managed KMS key or ensure that your user managed key policy grants the necessary permissions to the cluster role.
* Systems Manager control plane instances might have lost internet access. Check if the subnet that was provided when you created the cluster has a NAT gateway and a VPC with an internet gateway. Use VPC reachability analyzer to verify that the control plane instance can reach the internet gateway. For more information, see link:vpc/latest/reachability/getting-started.html[Getting started with VPC Reachability Analyzer,type="documentation"]. If your private networks don't have outbound internet connection, ensure that all the required VPC endpoints and gateway endpoint are still present in the Regional subnet from your cluster (see <<subnet-access-to-services>>).
* The role ARN that you provided is missing policies. Check if the <<security-iam-awsmanpol-amazonekslocaloutpostclusterpolicy,{aws} managed policy: AmazonEKSLocalOutpostClusterPolicy>> was not removed from the role. 
* One of the new Kubernetes control-plane instances may have experienced an unexpected bootstrapping failure. Please file a ticket with link:support/home[{aws} Support Center,type="console"] for further guidance on troubleshooting and log-collection in this exceptional case.

When an Outpost gets disconnected from the {aws} Region that it's associated with, the Kubernetes cluster likely will continue working normally. However, if the cluster doesn't work properly, follow the troubleshooting steps in <<eks-outposts-network-disconnects,Prepare local Amazon EKS clusters on {aws} Outposts for network disconnects>>. If you encounter other issues, contact {aws} Support. {aws} Support can guide you on downloading and running a log collection tool. That way, you can collect logs from your Kubernetes cluster control plane instances and send them to {aws} Support support for further investigation.
