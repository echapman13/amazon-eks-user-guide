= Review release notes for Kubernetes versions on extended support
:info_titleabbrev: Extended support versions

[abstract]
--
This topic gives important changes to be aware of for each Kubernetes version in extended support.
--

Amazon EKS supports Kubernetes versions longer than they are supported upstream, with standard support for Kubernetes minor versions for 14 months from the time they are released in Amazon EKS, and extended support for Kubernetes minor versions for an additional 12 months of support (26 total months per version).

This topic gives important changes to be aware of for each [.noloc]`Kubernetes` version in extended support. When upgrading, carefully review the changes that have occurred between the old and new versions for your cluster.


[#kubernetes-1-29]
== Kubernetes 1.29

Kubernetes `1.29` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.29`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====


* The deprecated `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta2` API version of `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` are no longer served in Kubernetes version `1.29`. If you have manifests or client software that uses the deprecated beta API group, you should change these before you upgrade to version `1.29`.

====

* The `.status.kubeProxyVersion` field for node objects is now deprecated, and the Kubernetes project is proposing to remove that field in a future release. The deprecated field is not accurate and has historically been managed by `kubelet` - which does not actually know the `kube-proxy` version, or even whether `kube-proxy` is running. If you've been using this field in client software, stop - the information isn't reliable and the field is now deprecated.
* In Kubernetes `1.29` to reduce potential attack surface, the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenCleanUp` feature labels legacy auto-generated secret-based tokens as invalid if they have not been used for a long time (1 year by default), and automatically removes them if use is not attempted for a long time after being marked as invalid (1 additional year by default). To identify such tokens, a you can run: 
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get cm kube-apiserver-legacy-service-account-token-tracking -n kube-system
----

[#kubernetes-1-28]
== Kubernetes 1.28

Kubernetes `1.28` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.28`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/kubernetes-v1-28-release/[official release announcement].



* Kubernetes `v1.28` expanded the supported skew between core node and control plane components by one minor version, from `n-2` to `n-3`, so that node components (``kubelet`` and `kube-proxy`) for the oldest supported minor version can work with control plane components (``kube-apiserver``, `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`, `cloud-controller-manager`) for the newest supported minor version.
* Metrics `force_delete_pods_total` and `force_delete_pod_errors_total` in the `Pod GC Controller` are enhanced to account for all forceful pods deletion. A reason is added to the metric to indicate whether the pod is forcefully deleted because it's terminated, orphaned, terminating with the out-of-service taint, or terminating and unscheduled.
* The `PersistentVolume (PV)` controller has been modified to automatically assign a default `StorageClass` to any unbound `PersistentVolumeClaim` with the `storageClassName` not set. Additionally, the `PersistentVolumeClaim` admission validation mechanism within the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual `StorageClass` name.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.28` changelog, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md#changelog-since-v1270.

[#kubernetes-1-27]
== Kubernetes 1.27

Kubernetes `1.27` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.27`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/11/kubernetes-v1-27-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====


* The support for the alpha `seccomp` annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io` annotations was removed. The alpha `seccomp` annotations was deprecated in `1.19`, and with their removal in `1.27`, `seccomp` fields will no longer auto-populate for `Pods` with `seccomp` annotations. Instead, use the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field for `Pods` or containers to configure `seccomp` profiles. To check whether you are using the deprecated alpha `seccomp` annotations in your cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | grep -E 'seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod|container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io'
----
* The `--container-runtime` command line argument for the `kubelet` was removed. The default container runtime for Amazon EKS has been `containerd` since `1.24`, which eliminates the need to specify the container runtime. From `1.27` onwards, Amazon EKS will ignore the `--container-runtime` argument passed to any bootstrap scripts. It is important that you don't pass this argument to `--kubelet-extra-args` in order to prevent errors during the node bootstrap process. You must remove the `--container-runtime` argument from all of your node creation workflows and build scripts.

====

* The `kubelet` in Kubernetes `1.27` increased the default `kubeAPIQPS` to `50` and `kubeAPIBurst` to `100`. These enhancements allow the `kubelet` to handle a higher volume of API queries, improving response times and performance. When the demands for `Pods` increase, due to scaling requirements, the revised defaults ensure that the `kubelet` can efficiently manage the increased workload. As a result, `Pod` launches are quicker and cluster operations are more effective.
* You can use more fine grained `Pod` topology to spread policies such as `minDomain`. This parameter gives you the ability to specify the minimum number of domains your `Pods` should be spread across. `nodeAffinityPolicy` and `nodeTaintPolicy` allow for an extra level of granularity in governing `Pod` distribution. This is in accordance to node affinities, taints, and the `matchLabelKeys` field in the `topologySpreadConstraints` of your `Pod's` specification. This permits the selection of `Pods` for spreading calculations following a rolling upgrade.
* Kubernetes `1.27` promoted to beta a new policy mechanism for `StatefulSets` that controls the lifetime of their `PersistentVolumeClaims`(`PVCs`). The new `PVC` retention policy lets you specify if the `PVCs` generated from the `StatefulSet` spec template will be automatically deleted or retained when the `StatefulSet` is deleted or replicas in the `StatefulSet` are scaled down.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/[goaway-chance] option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing. Amazon EKS version `1.27` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8[HTTP GOAWAY], we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination.

For the complete Kubernetes `1.27` changelog, see https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md#changelog-since-v1260.

[#kubernetes-1-26]
== Kubernetes 1.26

Kubernetes `1.26` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.26`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/09/kubernetes-v1-26-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====

Kubernetes `1.26` no longer supports CRI `v1alpha2`. This results in the `kubelet` no longer registering the node if the container runtime doesn't support CRI `v1`. This also means that Kubernetes `1.26` doesn't support containerd minor version `1.5` and earlier. If you're using containerd, you need to upgrade to containerd version `1.6.0` or later before you upgrade any nodes to Kubernetes `1.26`. You also need to upgrade any other container runtimes that only support the `v1alpha2`. For more information, defer to the container runtime vendor. By default, Amazon Linux and Bottlerocket AMIs include containerd version `1.6.6`.

====

* Before you upgrade to Kubernetes `1.26`, upgrade your Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes to version `1.12` or later. If you don't upgrade to Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes version `1.12` or later, the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes will crash. For more information, see <<managing-vpc-cni>>.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/[goaway-chance] option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection.

[#kubernetes-1-25]
== Kubernetes 1.25

Kubernetes `1.25` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.25`, see the https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/[official release announcement].

[IMPORTANT]
====


* Amazon EC2 `P2` instances aren't supported on Amazon EKS because they require `NVIDIA` driver version 470 or earlier.
* `PodSecurityPolicy` (PSP) is removed in Kubernetes `1.25`. PSPs are replaced with https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/[Pod Security Admission (PSA)] and Pod Security Standards (PSS). PSA is a built-in admission controller that implements the security controls outlined in the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[PSS]. PSA and PSS are graduated to stable in Kubernetes `1.25` and are enabled in Amazon EKS by default. If you have PSPs in your cluster, make sure to migrate from PSP to the built-in Kubernetes PSS or to a policy-as-code solution before upgrading your cluster to version `1.25`. If you don't migrate from PSP, you might encounter interruptions to your workloads. For more information, see the <<pod-security-policy-removal-faq>>. 
* Kubernetes version `1.25` contains changes that alter the behavior of an existing feature known as API Priority and Fairness (APF). APF serves to shield the API server from potential overload during periods of heightened request volumes. It does this by placing restrictions on the number of concurrent requests that can be processed at any given time. This is achieved through the application of distinct priority levels and limits to requests originating from various workloads or users. This approach ensures that critical applications or high-priority requests receive preferential treatment, while simultaneously preventing lower priority requests from overwhelming the API server. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/[API Priority and Fairness] in the Kubernetes documentation or https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#api-priority-and-fairness[API Priority and Fairness] in the EKS Best Practices Guide.
+
These updates were introduced in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103521[PR #10352] and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118601[PR #118601]. Previously, APF treated all types of requests uniformly, with each request consuming a single unit of the concurrent request limit. The APF behavior change assigns higher units of concurrency to `LIST` requests due to the exceptionally heavy burden put on the API server by these requests. The API server estimates the number of objects that will be returned by a `LIST` request. It assigns a unit of concurrency that is proportional to the number of objects returned.
+
Upon upgrading to Amazon EKS version `1.25` or higher, this updated behavior might cause workloads with heavy `LIST` requests (that previously functioned without issue) to encounter rate limiting. This would be indicated by an HTTP 429 response code. To avoid potential workload disruption due to `LIST` requests being rate limited, we strongly encourage you to restructure your workloads to reduce the rate of these requests. Alternatively, you can address this issue by adjusting the APF settings to allocate more capacity for essential requests while reducing the capacity allocated to non-essential ones. For more information about these mitigation techniques, see https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/scalability/docs/control-plane/#preventing-dropped-requests[Preventing Dropped Requests] in the EKS Best Practices Guide. 
* Amazon EKS `1.25` includes enhancements to cluster authentication that contain updated YAML libraries. If a YAML value in the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` found in the `kube-system` namespace starts with a macro, where the first character is a curly brace, you should add quotation marks (`" "`) before and after the curly braces (`{ }`). This is required to ensure that `aws-iam-authenticator` version `v0.6.3` accurately parses the `aws-auth` `ConfigMap` in Amazon EKS `1.25`.
* The beta API version (`discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1`) of `EndpointSlice` was deprecated in Kubernetes `1.21` and is no longer served as of Kubernetes `1.25`. This API has been updated to `discovery.k8s.io/v1`. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#endpointslice-v125[EndpointSlice] in the Kubernetes documentation. The {aws} Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.6` and earlier used the `v1beta1` endpoint to communicate with `EndpointSlices`. If you're using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the {aws} Load Balancer Controller, you must upgrade to {aws} Load Balancer Controller `v2.4.7` _before_ upgrading your Amazon EKS cluster to `1.25`. If you upgrade to `1.25` while using the `EndpointSlices` configuration for the {aws} Load Balancer Controller, the controller will crash and result in interruptions to your workloads. To upgrade the controller, see <<aws-load-balancer-controller>>.
* The beta API version (`autoscaling/v2beta1`) of HorizontalPodAutoscaler is no longer served as of Kubernetes `1.25`. This API was deprecated in version `1.23`. Migrate manifests and API clients to use the `autoscaling/v2` HorizontalPodAutoscaler API version. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#horizontalpodautoscaler-v125[the Kubernetes documentation]. 

====

* `SeccompDefault` is promoted to beta in Kubernetes `1.25`. By setting the `--seccomp-default` flag when you configure `kubelet`, the container runtime uses its `RuntimeDefaultseccomp` profile, rather than the unconfined (`seccomp disabled`) mode. The default profiles provide a strong set of security defaults, while preserving the functionality of the workload. Although this flag is available, Amazon EKS doesn't enable this flag by default, so Amazon EKS behavior is effectively unchanged. If you want to, you can start enabling this on your nodes. For more details, see the tutorial https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/#enable-the-use-of-runtimedefault-as-the-default-seccomp-profile-for-all-workloads/[Restrict a Container's Syscalls with seccomp] in the Kubernetes documentation.
* Support for the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) for Docker (also known as dockershim) was removed from Kubernetes `1.24` and later. The only container runtime in Amazon EKS official AMIs for Kubernetes `1.24` and later clusters is containerd. Before upgrading to Amazon EKS `1.24` or later, remove any reference to bootstrap script flags that aren't supported anymore. For more information, see <<dockershim-deprecation>>.
* The support for wildcard queries was deprecated in CoreDNS `1.8.7` and removed in CoreDNS `1.9`. This was done as a security measure. Wildcard queries no longer work and return NXDOMAIN instead of an IP address.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/[goaway-chance] option in the Kubernetes API server helps prevent `HTTP/2` client connections from being stuck on a single API server instance, by randomly closing a connection. When the connection is closed, the client will try to reconnect, and will likely land on a different API server as a result of load balancing. Amazon EKS version `1.25` has enabled `goaway-chance` flag. If your workload running on Amazon EKS cluster uses a client that is not compatible with https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-6.8[HTTP GOAWAY], we recommend that you update your client to handle `GOAWAY` by reconnecting on connection termination.
