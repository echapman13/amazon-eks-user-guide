== Cost monitoring using {aws} split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS
You can use {aws} split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS to get granular cost visibility for your Amazon EKS clusters. This enables you to analyze, optimize, and chargeback cost and usage for your Kubernetes applications. You allocate application costs to individual business units and teams based on Amazon EC2 CPU and memory resources consumed by your Kubernetes application. Split cost allocation data for Amazon EKS gives visibility into cost per Pod, and enables you to aggregate the cost data per Pod using namespace, cluster, and other Kubernetes primitives. The following are examples of Kubernetes primitives that you can use to analyze Amazon EKS cost allocation data.  

* Cluster name 
* Deployment 
* Namespace 
* Node 
* Workload Name 
* Workload Type 

link:costmanagement/home#/tags[User-defined cost allocation tags,type="console"] are also supported. For more information about using split cost allocation data, see link:cur/latest/userguide/split-cost-allocation-data.html[Understanding split cost allocation data,type="documentation"] in the {aws} Billing User Guide.
