= Enable EKS Auto Mode on existing EKS clusters
:info_titleabbrev: Enable existing clusters

[abstract]
--
Learn about the tools needed for creating and working with an Amazon EKS cluster in EKS Auto Mode.
--

You can enable EKS Auto Mode on existing EKS Clusters. 

[NOTE]
====
EKS Auto Mode requires Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater. EKS Auto Mode isn't available in the `ap-southeast-7` or `mx-central-1` {aws} Regions.
====

*{aws} supports the following migrations:*

* Migrating from Karpenter to EKS Auto Mode Nodes
** Learn how to <<auto-migrate-karpenter>>
* Migrating from EKS Managed Node Groups to EKS Auto Mode Nodes
** Learn how to <<auto-migrate-mng>>

*{aws} does not support the following migrations:*

* Migrating volumes from the EBS CSI Controller to EKS Auto Mode Block Storage
* Migrating load balancers from the {aws} Load Balancer Controller to EKS Auto Mode 
** You can install the {aws} Load Balancer Controller on an Amazon EKS Auto Mode cluster. Use the `IngressClass` or `loadBalancerClass` options to associate Service and Ingress resources with either the Load Balancer Controller or EKS Auto Mode. 
* Migrating EKS Clusters with alternative CNIs or other unsupported networking configurations

[#migration-reference]
== Migration Reference

Use the following migration reference to configure Kubernetes Resources to be owned by either self-managed controllers or EKS Auto Mode. 

[%header,cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===

| Capability | Resource | Field | Self Managed | EKS Auto Mode

| Block Storage | `StorageClass` | `provisioner` | `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs` | `ebs.csi.eks.amazonaws.com`

| Load Balancing | `Service` | `loadBalancerClass` | `service.k8s.aws/nlb` | `eks.amazonaws.com/nlb`

| Load Balancing | `IngressClass` | controller | `ingress.k8s.aws/alb` | `eks.amazonaws.com/alb`



| Load Balancing | `IngressClassParams` | `apiversion` | `elbv2.k8s.aws/v1beta1` | `eks.amazonaws.com/v1`

| Load Balancing | `TargetGroupBinding` | `apiversion` | `elbv2.k8s.aws/v1beta1` | `eks.amazonaws.com/v1`

| Compute | NodeClass | `apiVersion` | `karpenter.sh/v1alpha5` | `eks.amazonaws.com/v1`

== Migrating EBS Volumes

When migrating workloads to EKS Auto Mode, you need to handle EBS volume migration due to different CSI driver provisioners:

* EKS Auto Mode Provisioner: `ebs.csi.eks.amazonaws.com`
* Open Source EBS CSI Provisioner: `ebs.csi.aws.com`

Follow these steps to migrate your persistent volumes:

. **Modify volume retention policy**: Change the existing PV's `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` to `Retain` to ensure the underlying EBS volume is not deleted.
. **Remove PV from Kubernetes**: Delete the old PV resource while keeping the actual EBS volume intact.
. **Create a new PV with static provisioning**: Create a new PV that references the same EBS volume but works with the target CSI driver.
. **Bind to a new PVC**: Create a new PVC that specifically references your PV using the `volumeName` field.

=== Considerations

- Ensure your applications are stopped before beginning this migration
- Back up your data before starting the migration process
- This process needs to be performed for each persistent volume
- The workload must be updated to use the new PVC

== Migrating Load Balancers

You cannot directly transfer existing load balancers from the self-managed {aws} load balancer controller to EKS Auto Mode. Instead, you must implement a blue-green deployment strategy. This involves maintaining your existing load balancer configuration while creating new load balancers under the managed controller.

To minimize service disruption, we recommend a DNS-based traffic shifting approach. First, create new load balancers using EKS Auto Mode while keeping your existing configuration operational. Then, use DNS routing (such as Route 53) to gradually shift traffic from the old load balancers to the new ones. Once traffic has been successfully migrated and you've verified the new configuration, you can decommission the old load balancers and self-managed controller.
