[abstract]
--
Learn how to install and use Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, with your Amazon EKS cluster to manage and deploy applications seamlessly.
--

The Helm package manager for Kubernetes helps you install and manage applications on your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see the https://docs.helm.sh/[Helm documentation]. This topic helps you install and run the Helm binaries so that you can install and manage charts using the Helm CLI on your local system.

[IMPORTANT]
====

Before you can install Helm charts on your Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure `kubectl`  to work for Amazon EKS. If you have not already done this, see <<create-kubeconfig>> before proceeding. If the following command succeeds for your cluster, you're properly configured.

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
kubectl get svc
----

====
. Run the appropriate command for your client operating system.
+
** If you're using macOS with https://brew.sh/[Homebrew], install the binaries with the following command.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
brew install helm
----
** If you're using Windows with https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey], install the binaries with the following command.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
choco install kubernetes-helm
----
** If you're using Linux, install the binaries with the following commands.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
----
+
NOTE: If you get a message that `openssl` must first be installed, you can install it with the following command. 

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
sudo yum install openssl
----
. To pick up the new binary in your `PATH`, Close your current terminal window and open a new one.
. See the version of Helm that you installed.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
helm version --template='{{ .Version }}{{ "\n" }}'
----
+
An example output is as follows.
+
[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
v3.17.2
----
. Make sure the version installed is compatible with your cluster version. Check https://helm.sh/docs/topics/version_skew/#supported-version-skew[Supported Version Skew] to learn more. For example, if you are running with `3.17.x`, supported Kubernetes version should not out of the range of `1.29.x` ~ `1.32.x`.
+
. At this point, you can run any Helm commands (such as `helm install [.replaceable]``chart-name```) to install, modify, delete, or query Helm charts in your cluster. If you're new to Helm and don't have a specific chart to install, you can:
+
** Experiment by installing an example chart. See https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart#install-an-example-chart[Install an example chart] in the Helm https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/[Quickstart guide].
** Create an example chart and push it to Amazon ECR. For more information, see link:AmazonECR/latest/userguide/push-oci-artifact.html[Pushing a Helm chart,type="documentation"] in the _Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide_.
** Install an Amazon EKS chart from the https://github.com/aws/eks-charts#eks-charts[eks-charts]GitHub repo or from https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?page=1&repo=aws[ArtifactHub].
