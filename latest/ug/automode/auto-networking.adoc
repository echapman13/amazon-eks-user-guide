= Learn about VPC Networking and Load Balancing in EKS Auto Mode
:info_titleabbrev: Networking

This topic explains how to configure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking and load balancing features in EKS Auto Mode. While EKS Auto Mode manages most networking components automatically, you can still customize certain aspects of your cluster's networking configuration through NodeClass resources and load balancer annotations.

When you use EKS Auto Mode, {aws} manages the VPC Container Network Interface (CNI) configuration and load balancer provisioning for your cluster. You can influence networking behaviors by defining NodeClass objects and applying specific annotations to your Service and Ingress resources, while maintaining the automated operational model that EKS Auto Mode provides.

== Networking capability

EKS Auto Mode has a new networking capability that handles node and pod networking. You can configure it by creating a `NodeClass` Kubernetes object. 

Configuration options for the previous {aws} VPC CNI will not apply to EKS Auto Mode. 

=== Configure networking with NodeClass

The NodeClass resource in EKS Auto Mode allows you to customize certain aspects of the networking capability. Through NodeClass, you can specify security group selections, control node placement across VPC subnets, set SNAT policies, configure network policies, and enable network event logging. This approach maintains the automated operational model of EKS Auto Mode while providing flexibility for network customization.

You can use a NodeClass to:

* Select a Security Group for Nodes
* Control how nodes are placed on VPC Subnets
* Set the Node SNAT Policy to `random` or `disabled`
* Set the Network Policy to Default Deny or Default Allow
* Enable Network Event Logging to a file.

=== Considerations

EKS Auto Mode supports:

* EKS Network Policies.
* The `HostPort` and `HostNetwork` options for Kubernetes Pods.
* Pods in public or private subnets.
* Caching DNS queries on the node.

EKS Auto Mode does *not* support:

* Security Groups per Pod (SGPP).
* Custom Networking. The IP Addresses of Pods and Nodes must be from the same CIDR Block.
* Warm IP, warm prefix, and warm ENI configurations.
* Minimum IP targets configuration.
* Enabling or disabling prefix delegation.
* Other configurations supported by the open-source {aws} CNI.
* Network Policy configurations such as conntrack timer customization (default is 300s).
* Exporting network event logs to CloudWatch.

=== Network Resource Management

EKS Auto Mode handles prefix, IP addressing, and network interface management by monitoring NodeClass resources for networking configurations. The service performs several key operations automatically:

*Prefix Delegation*

EKS Auto Mode provisions `/28` IPv4 prefixes to the primary network interface for nodes and maintains a predefined warm pool of resources that scales based on the number of scheduled pods. When necessary, it provisions secondary network interfaces with identical security groups as the primary interface in the node's subnet. If prefixes are no longer available in the subnet, the service falls back to secondary IPv4 addresses.

*Cooldown Management*

The service implements a cooldown pool for prefixes or secondary IPv4 addresses that are no longer in use. After the cooldown period expires, these resources are released back to the VPC. However, if pods reuse these resources during the cooldown period, they are restored from the cooldown pool.

*IPv6 Support*

For IPv6 clusters, EKS Auto Mode provisions a `/80` IPv6 prefix per node on the primary network interface.

The service also ensures proper management and garbage collection of all network interfaces.

== Load balancing

You configure {aws} Elastic Load Balancers provisioned by EKS Auto Mode using annotations on Service and Ingress resources. 

For more information, see <<auto-configure-alb>> or <<auto-configure-nlb>>.

=== Considerations for load balancing with EKS Auto Mode

* The default targeting mode is IP Mode, not Instance Mode.
* EKS Auto Mode only supports Security Group Mode for Network Load Balancers. 
* {aws} does not support migrating load balancers from the self managed {aws} load balancer controller to management by EKS Auto Mode.
* The `networking.ingress.ipBlock` field in `TargetGroupBinding` spec is not supported. 
* If your worker nodes use custom security groups (not `eks-cluster-sg-*` naming pattern), your cluster role needs additional IAM permissions.  The default EKS-managed policy only allows EKS to modify security groups named `eks-cluster-sg-*`. Without permission to modify your custom security groups, EKS cannot add the required ingress rules that allow ALB/NLB traffic to reach your pods.
