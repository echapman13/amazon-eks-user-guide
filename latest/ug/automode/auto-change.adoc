**Bug Fix:** Auto Mode nodes now resolve `kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local` correctly when there isn't a `kube-dns` service installed in the cluster. Addresses GitHub issue https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/2546[#2546].

**Feature**: `IPv4` egress enabled in `IPv6` clusters. `IPv4` traffic egressing from `IPv6` Auto Mode clusters will now be automatically translated to the `v4` address of the node primary ENI.
